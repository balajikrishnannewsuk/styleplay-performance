# These tests are expected to bypass the kong gateway and hit the API endpoints directly.
# Make sure that the scenarios run below are requesting the public ELB for profile-api.

# If the tests go through Kong, make sure you announce on the #db-api-gateway-tests channel
# that you're running the tests so you don't affect other tenants who also use Kong
