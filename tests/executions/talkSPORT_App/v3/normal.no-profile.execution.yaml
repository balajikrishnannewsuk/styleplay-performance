# Normal load increase on opening the app and viewing each screen
# Given we have 5k users on the app once
# assuming these users open the app over a 5 minute period
# This nets us a throughput of 13 hits per second
# There is no interaction with profile API

# Normal load increase on apps refreshing after the program changes
#
# Apps refresh over a 50 second window.
# They are grouped into 10 groups spaced out between 5 second intervals.
# Every 5 seconds, one tenth of apps refresh
# Only the current screen they have open refreshes
#
# Given we have 5k open apps, all on a single screen (for example, tuning into a chat show)
# we can expect 500 attempting to refresh at once. We can afford to take 5 seconds to respond to all 500 requests.
#
# We should expect a throughput of a minimum of 100 requests per second
